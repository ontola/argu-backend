# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one:
  commentable: one (Argument)
  profile: :one
  body: "Just a comment"
#
two:
  commentable: one (Argument)
  profile: :one
  is_trashed: true
  body: "Just a second comment"
